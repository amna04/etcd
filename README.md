# etcd
etcd related documents, process and as build
While deploying etcd cluster for work, I have faced so many issues and wanted to simplify the process for myself. In the process if it helps other that would be a great outcome.

This repo is intended for people who knows what they are doing. Please don't follow this if you have no prior knowledge of certificates, openssl and repo is not put in a structured order.

I have used openssl as that would be an standard for any enterprise environment.
